# Missing Python Requirements in Docker Image

This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error where the required Python packages are not installed correctly within the image.  The initial `Dockerfile` attempts to install requirements, but fails because the `requirements.txt` file is not copied correctly.

**Problem:** The `COPY` instruction is missing the source path for `requirements.txt`. This results in an error during the `pip install` phase, because the file isn't found.

**Solution:** The `Dockerfile_solution.txt` provides the corrected `Dockerfile`. The fix includes specifying the correct source path for the `requirements.txt` file during the `COPY` command.

## How to reproduce the error:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Build the original `Dockerfile` using `docker build -t my-app .`
3. Observe the build failure due to a missing file.

## How to fix the error:
1. Replace the original `Dockerfile` with `Dockerfile_solution.txt`
2. Build the corrected `Dockerfile` using `docker build -t my-app .`
3. The build should now succeed.
